This assignment is to have you use Sentinel-Controlled Repetition and the Statistics library. 

It is your job to write a program to calculate the average cost of frozen vegetables in the grocery store. 
You will ask the user for three pieces of information each loop through the program -  the size of the bag of vegetables purchased (in grams), 
the cost of the bag (in $), and the name of the product. From the size and cost of the bag, you will be able to calculate the cost per 100g, 
which is what is often displayed in the grocery store. So, if the user enters a bag of rice at 500 grams and $3.99, then the answer will be $0.798 / 100 grams. 
(The math is (size / price)*100.) Round your output to 3 decimal places.

Allow the user to enter in as many entries as they would like, calculating the cost per 100 grams for each bag. When the user indicates that they are done, 
calculate and output the following:

The overall cost
The overall weight
Overall cost per 100g (for the total weight and the total price)
The mean cost per bag (what is the average price per bag)
The median cost per bag
The max / min costs per bag
The max / min bag sizes
What item was the most expensive
What item was the most expensive per gram
